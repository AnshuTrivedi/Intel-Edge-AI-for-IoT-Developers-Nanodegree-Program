    "Mr. Ben works for a small pharmaceutical company that has a manufacturing factory in Ireland. It is important to analyze each drug package they manufacture before it is shipped off to customers. This analysis involves counting the number of drug bottles inside a package. They have a strict time period of 500 ms to analyze each package. If they fail to perform the analysis in this time frame, their whole manufacturing pipeline will get delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company is looking for ways to grow, but is much smaller than its competitors and has a very limited budget. Mr. Ben wants to find a low-cost way to ramp up production by 15% this quarter. To accomplish this, the analysis time will need to be improved so that it is completed within 300ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, the company is using CPUs to perform this analysis, but the current processors are already functioning at capacity in order to achieve the 500 ms analysis time."
