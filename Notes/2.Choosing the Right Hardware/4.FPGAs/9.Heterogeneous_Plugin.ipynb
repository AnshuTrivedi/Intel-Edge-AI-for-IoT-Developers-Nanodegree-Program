What we would like to do is be able to run our model primarily on the FPGA, but if an unsupported layer is needed, have this run on a device where it is supported rather than crashing. We can accomplish this goal using OpenVINO's heterogeneous (HETERO) plugin.\n",

If you want to assign layers in a more granular fashion, you can use the **`affinity option`**, which you can read more about [here](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_HETERO.html). Being able to assign specific layers to particular devices can also be helpful in debugging."
