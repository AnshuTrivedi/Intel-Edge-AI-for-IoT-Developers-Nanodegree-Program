    "* `Model compression refers to a group of algorithms that help us reduce the amount of memory needed to store our model, and also make our models more compact (in terms of the number of parameters).`\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, `you have already learned about a model-compression algorithm, quantization,` where we reduce the number of bits required to represent each weight."

    "\n",
    "Another way to compress our model is `to reduce the number of weights that we store`. This is known as weight sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In weight sharing, the `goal is for multiple weights to share the same value. This reduces the number of unique weights `that need to be stored, thus saving memory and reducing model size."
