  Optimizations on the Pre-Trained Models

  > Precisions are related to floating point values - less precision means less memory used by the model, 
   and less compute resources. 
  > However, there are some trade-offs with accuracy when using lower precision. 
  > There is also fusion, where multiple layers can be fused into a single operation. 
  > These are achieved through the Model Optimizer in OpenVINOâ„¢, although the Pre-Trained Models have already been run 
    through that process.
