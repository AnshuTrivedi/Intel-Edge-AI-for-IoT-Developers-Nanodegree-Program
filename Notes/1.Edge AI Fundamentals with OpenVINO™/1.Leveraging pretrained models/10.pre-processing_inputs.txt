  > Varies by model
  > color channel order matter (RGB or BGR)
  > Image resizing 
  > Normalization


  > It can even matter what library you use to load an image or frame - OpenCV, which weâ€™ll use to read and handle images 
   in this course, reads them in the BGR format, which may not match the RGB images some networks may have
   used to train with.
 > Outside of channel order, you also need to consider image size, and the order of the image data, 
  such as whether the color channels come first or last in the dimensions. 
  Certain models may require a certain normalization of the images for input, such as pixel values between 0 and 1,
  although some networks also do this as their first layer.
