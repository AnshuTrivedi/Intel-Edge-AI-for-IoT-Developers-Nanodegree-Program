Note: We are using the 2019R3 version of the OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit in the classroom. In 2020R1 (and likely future updates), the INT8 precision has been re-named to FP32-INT8. As such, if working locally with 2020R1, while the download does not currently fail if you specify INT8, the related download directory will be empty. 
      You would therefore need to instead specify FP32-INT8 as the --precisions argument if using the latest version.

1. Choosing Models
  > I chose the following models for the three tasks:
    > Human Pose Estimation: human-pose-estimation-0001
    > Text Detection: text-detection-0004
    > Determining Car Type & Color: vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039

2. Downloading Models
   > To navigate to the directory containing the Model Downloader
   > cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader
   > Within there, you'll notice a downloader.py file, and can use the -h argument with it to see available arguments.
   > python downloader.py -h 
   > For this exercise, --name for model name, and --precisions, used when only certain precisions are desired,
     are the important arguments.
  > so you should also use the -o argument to specify your output directory as /home/workspace 
    (which will download into a created intel folder therein).

  > Downloading Human Pose Model
     sudo ./downloader.py --name human-pose-estimation-0001 -o /home/workspace
  > Downloading Text Detection Model
     sudo ./downloader.py --name text-detection-0004 --precisions FP16 -o /home/workspace
  > Downloading Car Metadata Model
     sudo ./downloader.py --name vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039 --precisions INT8 -o /home/workspace

3. Verifying Downloads
  > The downloader itself will tell you the directories these get saved into, but to verify yourself, 
   first start in the /home/workspace directory (or the same directory as the Model Downloader if on your
   local machine without the -o argument). 
> From there, you can cd intel, and then you should see three directories -
 one for each downloaded model. Within those directories, there should be separate subdirectories for the precisions 
 that were downloaded, and then .xml and .bin files within those subdirectories, that make up the model.
